# Online Privacy

1. Install a trustworthy and non-logging [VPN client](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/vpn/#recommended-providers).
1. Install a secure [password manager](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/passwords/#cloud-based).
1. Install a privacy focused [browser](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/desktop-browsers/)
    - Use **HTTPS-only mode**.
    - Turn off **DNS over HTTPS** (FF) / **Secure DNS** (Chrome)
      - Use this (turn it on) only when disconnected from a VPN service. When you're already connected to a VPN service the security benefits of using encrypted DNS is negligible and it will always be slower than using the DNS resolver on the VPN server that you are connected to.
        - Configure a custom [DNS provider](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/dns/#recommended-providers).
    - Install [ads and trackers blockers](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/browser-extensions/#content-blockers).
    - Change your default search engine to a privacy-friendly [alternative](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/search-engines/#recommended-providers).
1. Install a privacy-focused [messaging app](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/real-time-communication/).
1. Perform a connection check for IP/WebRTC/DNS leaks
